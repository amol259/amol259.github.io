A good resume should have several clear and important aspects to highlight a canidates experience clearly and efficently. In this post I will assume the canidate is a soon to be college grad looking for a full time position. It should include the following sections in this order:
1. Education
2. Relevant Work Experience 
3. Projects
4. Leadership or Extracuricular activites
5. Technical skills list
