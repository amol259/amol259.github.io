A good resume should have several clear and important aspects to highlight a canidates experience clearly and efficently. In this post I will assume the canidate is a soon to be college grad looking for a full time position. It should include the following sections in this order:
1. Education: Simply state the university you attend, major, GPA(if above 3.0), and graduation date

2. Relevant Work Experience: List in detail you're internship experince, really outline both the technical aspect but also the buisness value of the project you worked on. Recruiters like numbers and percentages so incorparate these if you automated a procedure. Some people may disagree but in my opinon i believe you should not list any non-relevant work experience. In my experience the recruiters never mention it and it just ends up takind space on the resume. 

3. Projects: List school and personal projects you've worked on. These have the potential to be as valuable as a internship so really focus on adding a few of these to the resume.

4. Leadership or Extracuricular activites: This is a good section to add some flavor to distinguish a resume. Especially if you were a leader in a club on campus. This section is usually discussed in behavioral interviews. 

5. Technical skills list: Lastly make a short list of the main technologies you know. This gives recruiters a clear idea of what you're capable of and if you fit into the role they're looking for.

I have posted an example of a resume following
